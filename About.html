<h1>About This Visualization</h1>
<p> My Visualization follows a interactive slideshow style. It highlights how the Fighting Illini basketball team did in comparison with the rest of the Big Ten.
Apart from the overview slide an the introduction slide, the slides each follow one of the two templates.
There is one template in which I show a paragraph description. This paragraph written in blue discusses the trends of the next few slides.
Following the first template is the bar graph template. This template has all the big ten colleges and a statistical trend.
Each slide has a different trend, from rebounds, steals, points per game, etc.
You can hover over the bars to see the numbers. Also, if you click on the top you can order the teams differently. 
By default, the top bar is the team with the best of that statistic and the bottom is the worst of that statistic.
The overview slide follows a different template. It is a table of all the statistics. 
By default, the colleges are given in order of rank (top with best rank and bottom with worst), but you can order the college different based on another category.
You just have to click that category. Once again you can hover over the table to see the numerical values better.
Also, click on the forward arrow on the left of the screen to advance slides and backwards to go back.
This is a circular slideshow, so the last slide would point forward to the first slide.
