My Visualization follows a interactive slideshow style. It highlights how the Fighting Illini basketball team did in comparison with the rest of the Big Ten. Apart from the overview slide an the introduction slide, the slides each follow one of the two templates. There is one template in which I show a paragraph description. This paragraph written in blue discusses the trends of the next few slides. The other slide follows a gantt bar chart structure. To navigate from slide to slide you click on the arrows on the sides

# Introduction, Starters & Table
The first slide is just the Illini basketball symbol and has a hyperlink "About this Visualization" that links to a description page. The next slide shows a description of all the starters on the Fighting Illini basketball team and highlights their key statistics and accomplishments. Following that slide is a description slide, containing just text to describe the following slide about the overview table. The fourth slide is the overview table embedded from tableau public. This slide contains all the various statistics and teams. The teams are placed top to bottom in rank order. Howevevr you can click on the metric above to rank them in top bottom order using any metric.

# General Slide Template
Following the overview table are a bunch of slides following a similar ghantt bar chart or description format. The order alternates between description and gantt bar chart. The descriptions tell you about what is on the next slide and give big picture analysis about the Fighting Illini Basketball team. Its format is similar to the description before the overview table. The ghantt bar chart slides contain gantt bar charts embedded from tableau public with the team as the nominal variable and the statistic as a continuous variable. You can change the order of the teams from highest to lowest or lowest to highest by clicking the top. There is tooltip so you can hover on the bars and you get the team and actual statistic.
